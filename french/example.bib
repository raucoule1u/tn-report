Those two technologies have been used in order to implement a	Global Trust Service Status List (gTSL) in a decentralized and secure manner. The objective of using Ethereum & IPFS is to store the whole data regarding the gTSL in a distributed network. In this paper, we present an overview of each technology, the design of the adopted solution and the version control designed on top of IPFS which is used to keep track of the gTSL history."
